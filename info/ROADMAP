- ctrl-c caused extra reapers are spewing to console, file a bug...
- update-mirrors should take arg of e.g. /var/mirrors or ~/.viros/mirrors
- need to actually time phases with vdefs qmem of 422 vs 512 vs 1024 to optimize
- simple qfr input-path output-diskimage that yields a partd/fmtd/populated .vsi
 - and vice versa that takes that vsi and generates a tar to diff against.  good regression test.

- fundamental
  - cachedir functionality
    - at first, at least a mirror management howto
    - use yumdownloader, yum groupinfo, and createrepo to do a 
      full blown livecd-tools equivalent cachedir functionality
  - centos support (stock e-zyx example)
  - debian support (stock deb-zyx example)

- documentation
  - more and better howtos, integrated into release
    - cheesy graphics/diagrams/figs
      - one for platform computing
      - show viros at bottom, inputting f/u, outputting gz livecd
      - one for control+arrows, one for matrix
    - need links to basic things such as oss/gnu/linux distro, livecd, ...
      - i.e. wikipedia articles (locally cached, sanity checked)

  - also command documentation, in standard format that trivially exports
    to text, and xhtml.

- testing
  - sanity test
  - include qrig booting sanity test iso output, with screenshot and imagediff

- official test matrix for releases
  - 4 systems (aka k5k1apietool)

- development infrastructure
  - mailman mailinglist (need vserver)
  - bugzilla
  - signed releases
  - gitweb
  - git tree

- features
  - ntfs loopback installer

- python
  - present python api
    - for smirfgen (perhaps could be plug in mayflower replacement)
    - for qfakeroot (definitely a plug-in for livecd-tools restorecon issue
    - for own gui and/or revisor
  - rewrite many parts in python
    - once api layer is there, at leisure, rewrite in python
    - start with smirfgen and qfakeroot

- mutate
  - recursive unsplice
  - resplice

- vxmog::zyx-live
  - proper udf support

- liveusb:(litd/vxmog)
  - efi
  
- trait::sysinfo.srpms
  - proper yum-builddep closure

- qrap
  - needs to utilize vregopt

- savetrait
  - don't store multiples of same traits, but add some sort of
    traitname= to the options file
    - thus could save traits in single traitrepo useful dir
