Summary:
--------

VirOS is a Free and Open Source Software[1] tool which allows you to
easily create LiveOS[2] distributions descended from other popular
existing distributions.  In a practical sense, it will allow you to
make a new LiveDVD .iso image based on, e.g. ScientificLinux's 6rolling
repositories, customized to your needs and specifications.  I.e. you
can easily add or remove packages.  You can use little bash scripts
that VirOS can ingest as 'traits' to do whatever you want, install
software, tweak systemwide gconf settings, add browser extensions, ...
But more generally, VirOS allows anyone to easily become their own 
distribution maintainer.  In fact, it is so easy, an admin can create
a distro for every type of system they are in charge of, such that they
could reinstall all of them from an offsite pouch of usb sticks, and
be disaster-recovered in an amazingly short period of time.  Or all of
the other traditional varied uses of VM system/appliance images and
LiveCD/DVD/USB/s.  The core of VirOS is to make the synthesis, mutation,
and transmogrification of such system images, be as pushbutton and
simple as possible.  It's still a little rough around the edges
development-wise, but with el6, things might be nearing a 1.0 release.

Overview:
---------

NOTE: for now, scan to end of file for relevent quasi overview/usage

1) how to install (from yum repo)
- how to optionally mirror
- how to build first minimal and x-zyx strains

viros spawn \
    --strain=minimal \
    --output=mylive.iso 

viros spawn \
    --strain=/usr/lib/viros/strains/x-zyx-latest.vml \
    --output=mylive.iso 

- how to build first modified, 
  - logochange(1) and package install(tuxracer)
- how to install/burn results to livedvd/liveusb
- how to install/migrate live mode to installed mode
- goto step 1

========================================================================

System Requirements:
--------------------


- SW
 - OS
  - X/Sci-ZyX/SL6alpha is the present preferred OS
  - f13 worked the last time I tried it, but that was months ago
  - CentOS-5.* was tested maybe a year ago and worked somewhat then
 - Virt
  - qemu-0.11.1 is tested on x86, kvm untested on 32/64 but may work

- HW
 - x86 works
 -  x86_64 has never been tried, to be tested when I have access to hw
 - Memory: 1024M min-supported, 2048+ recommended, 512M might work
 - Disk: recommended: 10 times the output iso size (~20G for 2G .iso)
 - timing tests on an 2 year old atom netbook with 1G are forthcoming
 - on a 3 yr old core(1)duo 2G vaio laptop, upwards of 12 hour build


========================================================================

Development:
------------

- getting a git tree from viros.sf.net, or source rpm
- how to build (and use from download)
- mailinglist (viros-devel@users.sourceforge.net)
- design overview doc(todo)

========================================================================

Roadmap:
--------

- 64bit
- *el-6.1 timeframe goals
- revive selinux support/testing for el6, hhuey style xmog option
- future debian ancestor support
- ...

========================================================================

Support:
--------

- sf forums (viros.sf.net)
- tutorials (cloudsession.com/dawg/projects/viros)

========================================================================

History:
--------

- tvos 'powered by VirOS' circa 2001 printed by mixonic.com
- genesis of livecd-tools
 - my lfs analysis (ignorant of past casper dm-ss use)
 - rebootless bluesky
 - soas/godfather/zli
- g-z on lwn distro list in 2k4?
- guitar-zyx first release in early 2k9?
- viros first public release- 2k7 (unionfs for fc5 very loosely related)
  - 2k7 jan/feb, first fc6 single command iso generation works (since
  mandrake-7/8 days)

========================================================================

sigh... no real documentation yet.
----------------------------------

fitness/zbuild is the script used by the author, and not a bad place to
start.

likewise tools/scripts/update-mirrors.el6 is the script used by the
author to create his /var/mirrors/el6 which is referenced in zbuild.

Though 

./viros spawn \
    --strain=minimal \
    --output=mylive.iso 

should work as well.

ymmv...

tutorial polishing and qa coming soon...

========================================================================

feedback and patches are encouraged

========================================================================

note: the VirOS package currently does contain
trademarked artwork that is not redistributable
within a modified version of VirOS without 
permission.  If this is an inconvenience, let the
author know and refactoring to ease the process of
redistribution will be hastened.

========================================================================

note: this code is unpolished.  It has improved vastly
over the last few years, but still has vast cleanups still to go.

========================================================================

note: I presently do not have the hardware required to maintain a
development workstation in addition to an internet connected
workstation.  Thus there is some chance that after that happens, I
may choose to utilize a new git signing key.

Hardware donations as well as process suggestions are welcome.

========================================================================

note: other than a few clear exceptions, the initial git import of
this work is exclusively the work of Douglas McClendon.  Notable 
exceptions include (omissions would be considered a bug to file)

- full qemu-0.11.1 GPL source in traits/qemu_from_src
- full wmctrl GPL source in traits/wmctrl
- fedora (livecd-tools,initscripts) GPL code, 
  - in traits/zyx-live/etc/rc.d/init.d/*
  - in traits/zyx-live-iso-to-disk
  - in traits/zyx-live-f12*
- fedora configurations in strains/*fedora*
- ffox swifttabs GPL extension (needs updated version)
- other ffox extensions traits/*ffox*
- various external yum repository configurations

========================================================================

note, that ASAP a full 'author re-perusal' code review will be done,
of the tree initially imported to sourceforge git.  Primarily as a 
first level defense against the fact that for most of its life, the 
viros pre-git main development tree did live on an internet connected
development system.  The progress of that audit will be noted in 
some text document (this one for now).  Likewise the format of that 
progress will also be used for subsequent peer-review code audits.
