sigh... no real documentation yet.

fitness/zbuild is the script used by the author, 
and not a bad place to start.

Though 

./viros generate \
    --strain=F-ZyX \
    --output=mylive.iso 

should work as well.

ymmv...

feedback and patches are encouraged

note: the VirOS package currently does contain
trademarked artwork that is not redistributable
within a modified version of VirOS without 
permission.  If this is an inconvenience, let the
author know and refactoring to ease the process of
redistribution will be hastened.

note: this code is extremely unpolished.  It has improved vastly
over the last few years, but still has vast cleanups still to go.
