VirOS Known Bugs
----------------

- invoking viros mutate as root works inadequately due to qfakeroot having
  no good mechanism to identify the IP of the localhost (e.g. 10.0.2.2 for
  non-native qemu mode vs 127.0.0.1 for native chroot mode)

- on at least a couple occasions, qemu has come up, frozen in an alternate
  console mode ("parallel=0").  very rare, and not reproducable

- viros command frontend still attempts abbreviation, but currently does
  this less than successfully (at least when no match is found)

- running zbuild/vxmog/(qfr/smirfgen) can result in an unreaped qemu process,
  if ctrl-c'd at the wrong time.  Detected while adding the .kernel to output
  of --guest_smirf
