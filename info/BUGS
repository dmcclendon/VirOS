VirOS Known Bugs
----------------

- invoking viros mutate as root works inadequately due to qfakeroot having
  no good mechanism to identify the IP of the localhost (e.g. 10.0.2.2 for
  non-native qemu mode vs 127.0.0.1 for native chroot mode)

- on at least a couple occasions, qemu has come up, frozen in an alternate
  console mode ("parallel=0").  very rare, and not reproducable

- at least once, the f8 rescue iso oopsed before doing much, though there
  had been "-m 256 -m 320" on the qemu cmdline.  That is fixed now, but
  I suspect that reflects either a kernel bug irrespective of the qemu
  cmdline, or a qemu bug.

TESTING M-ZyX currently has unclean shutdown on /mnt/.LiveOS/overlayfs not mounted
  blablabla
