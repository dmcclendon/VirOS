# this is a gross way to workaround the fact that I don't yet know how 
# to easily/scriptomatically create a new named/themed icon, and even
# then I'm not sure that will be sufficient to get the customization that
# this achieves (replacing the icon, and hiding the computer name in gdm)
#
# Assumption is that this is sufficient (at bootup) because I don't think
# gdm rereads its glade file.  If it does, this might be better in or also
# in cron.daily
