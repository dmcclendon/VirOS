this should be rechecked to see if there is still a seeming package 
list difference between what fedora's livecd-tools generates for
a given kickstart, versus what anaconda via netinst.iso will install
with that same kickstart.  Though now that for el6, I'm focusing more on
a semi-custom minimal (min-e-zyx) strain, and building others on top
of that, instead of a fedora livecd clone attempt, so it may be easier
to go without this trait.
