the demon's will
----------------

our reflections

they will replace us,

and be replaced themselves...


will their demons...

drive them to war and peace


or will they drive out their demons...

in a war for peace


or will it be, being their will,

that they just taste another piece

another piece of bitter war


riding the coaster...

coasting along this ride

tired of the cage

tired of the stage

drained of sweat

drawned of blood

drained of tears

drained of fears

devoid of rage

hoping only

to turn the page


pass the agression

agree to the past

look deep inside 

beyond the learned helplessness

at the black void

of your burned out core reaction

beyond even the desire for captured time
