"middle age"

time is up
time is down
if you open your eyes,
you'll see time all around

time is deep
time is wide
one of these days, you can bet
time will not be on your side

the world has been resolved,
to stay the way it is,
until the time of the coming.

I am resolved, absolved, and yet seemingly unsolved.

Hear my words, 
for we all do our parts,
our love will ever be protected, 
because it lay, 
deep within our hearts.


time wearing down,
Whether the end, or just a start
time may remember, or it may forget,
but I am ready to see with my soul,
if the worst to come is yet.
